1.  Write a Perl function that takes in a password and checks whether it's valid.  The password should follow the following rule:

    Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
    Between 8-11: requires mixed case letters, numbers and symbols
    Between 12-15: requires mixed case letters and numbers
    Between 16-19: requires mixed case letters
    20+: any characters desired

 2. Parentheses removal function. Given a string containing an expression, return the expression with unnecessary parentheses removed.

    For example:

    f("1*(2+(3*(4+5)))") ===> "1*(2+3*(4+5))"
    f("2 + (3 / -5)") ===> "2 + 3 / -5"
    f("x+(y+z)+(t+((v+w)))") ===> "x+y+z+t+v+w"

Please write a function that removes unnecessary parenthesis for any given string. You can write this in any language but please provide it in an executable format with instructions.
